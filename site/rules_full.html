    <h2>5. Scoring & Results</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Qualifiers & Quarterfinals: ranking uses YouTube metrics from your season playlist (e.g., views, likes, engagement).</li>
      <li>Semifinals & Finals: ranking is a mix of YouTube metrics and <strong>jury scoring</strong> (creativity, clarity, team effort).</li>
      <li>Organizers may remove illegitimate activity (e.g., bot traffic) from scoring and may disqualify for manipulation.</li>
      <li>Results are published on the website/official channels. Organizer decisions are final for the MVP phase.</li>

      <li><strong>Anti-gaming:</strong> artificial boosting (bots, fake views/engagement, misleading practices) is prohibited and may lead to disqualification.</li>
