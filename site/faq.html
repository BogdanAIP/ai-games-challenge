  <h2>Who can join?</h2>
  <p>Anyone. Solo or team. You only need a public YouTube channel and a season playlist.</p>

  <p>No. Use your existing channel with a dedicated season playlist.</p>
  <h2>Which metrics are counted?</h2>
  <p>Views and likes from videos in your season playlist; engagement rate is capped. See <a href="./scoring.html">Scoring</a>.</p>
  <h2>Can I post on TikTok/IG?</h2>
  <p>Yes. All social is welcome, but the leaderboard uses only your YouTube season playlist.</p>
  <h2>How do you prevent cheating?</h2>
  <p>We only count post-registration uploads in your public playlist, cap engagement, and review suspicious patterns.</p>
